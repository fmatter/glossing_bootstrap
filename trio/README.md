# Task 1: Trió

[Trió/Tiriyó](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/trio1238) is a Cariban language spoken by around 2'000 people on the border between Suriname and Brazil.
The data here are from [Meira (1999)](https://scholarship.rice.edu/handle/1911/19417).
While the majority of it has been constructed, it is -- to the best of my knowledge -- grammatical Trió.

In the morpheme data, prefixes and suffixes are identified by preceding and following hyphens, and roots do not have hyphens.
The sentences are provided as space-delimited word forms.

Roots, pre- and suffixes are combined to grammatical words, or g-words.
What is delimited by spaces in a sentence -- intuitively a 'word' to most people -- is strictly speaking a phonological word (p-word).
Multiple g-words can be combined into a single p-word, think for example of the English (p-)words *mustn't* or *I've*, which contain the g-words *must* and *not* and *I* and *have*, respectively.
This is illustrated by the following example from the Pama-Nyungan language [Ngiyambaa](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/wang1291) ([Donaldson 1980](http://hdl.handle.net/11858/00-001M-0000-0012-9923-3): 131):

(2) ŋa-j-aka=t̪iː=ntu-kal     
    see-CONJ-IRR=1OBL=2NOM-PL 
    You all will see me.'
```


Here, there are three distinct word forms: *ŋajaka*, *t̪iː*, and *ntukal*, which can be further segmented as *ŋa-j-aka*, *t̪iː*, and *ntu-kal*, respectively.
As you can see in (2), g-words within a larger p-word are delimited with `=`, just like morphemes inside a g-word are delimited with `-`.
