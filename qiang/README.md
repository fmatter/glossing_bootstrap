# Task 2: Qiang

[Northern Qiang](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/nort2722) is a Tibeto-Burman language spoken by about 58'000 people in Tibet and in Sichuan, China.

Data is from [Forkel & Mattis (2020)](https://github.com/cldf-datasets/lapollaqiang/), who lifted it from [LaPolla & Huang (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110197273).

In this task, you only get limited information about morphemes: affixes are not specified as such in `morphemes.csv`
However, you get a large amount of parsed and glossed sentences (`sentences.csv`); your goal is to fill in the unparsed and unglossed sentences.
Note that `-` is used instead of `=` throughout.
